Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Importing Required Libraries

The necessary libraries are imported:

datasets: To load the IMDb dataset.
transformers: For loading the pre-trained BERT tokenizer and model.
torch: To handle PyTorch tensors and manage the model's forward pass.
sklearn.metrics: For computing evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and Cohen's kappa.
2. Loading the Pre-Trained Model and Tokenizer

model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)
Tokenizer: Converts raw text into token IDs compatible with the BERT model.
Model: A pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for sequence classification. The num_labels=2 indicates binary classification (e.g., positive or negative sentiment).
3. Loading the Dataset

dataset = load_dataset('imdb', split='test[:10%]')
The IMDb dataset is loaded, and a random 10% subset of the test split is used for evaluation to reduce computation time.
4. Tokenizing the Dataset

def preprocess_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], truncation=True, padding='max_length', max_length=512)

encoded_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
Preprocessing: Converts each review into a fixed-length sequence of token IDs.
truncation=True: Ensures that sequences longer than 512 tokens are truncated.
padding='max_length': Pads shorter sequences to the maximum length of 512 tokens.
Mapping: Applies the preprocess_function to each review in the dataset.
5. Converting Dataset to PyTorch Tensors

encoded_dataset.set_format(type='torch', columns=['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'label'])
This reformats the dataset to produce PyTorch tensors for:
input_ids: Token IDs for each review.
attention_mask: Indicates which tokens are padding.
label: Ground truth for the review (positive or negative).
6. Creating a DataLoader

dataloader = DataLoader(encoded_dataset, batch_size=8)
Batching: Groups tokenized reviews into batches of 8 to improve processing efficiency.
7. Model Evaluation

all_predictions = []
all_labels = []

for batch in dataloader:
    inputs = {key: batch[key].to(model.device) for key in ['input_ids', 'attention_mask']}
    labels = batch['label'].to(model.device)

    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)

    all_predictions.extend(predictions.cpu().numpy())
    all_labels.extend(labels.cpu().numpy())
Batch Processing:
Each batch is passed to the model.
The input_ids and attention_mask are sent to the model, and the label is used to compute metrics.
Model Output:
The outputs.logits contain the raw predictions for each class.
torch.argmax selects the class with the highest probability.
Predictions and ground truth labels are stored for later evaluation.
8. Computing Metrics

precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(all_labels, all_predictions, average='binary')
accuracy = (torch.tensor(all_predictions) == torch.tensor(all_labels)).sum().item() / len(all_labels)
cohen_kappa = cohen_kappa_score(all_labels, all_predictions)
Precision: The proportion of true positives among all predicted positives.
Recall: The proportion of true positives among all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified reviews.
Cohen's Kappa: A measure of agreement between predicted and actual labels, adjusted for chance agreement.
9. Printing Results

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.4f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
print(f"F1-Score: {f1:.4f}")
print(f"Cohen's Kappa: {cohen_kappa:.4f}")
The script outputs the model's performance metrics, providing a comprehensive view of its classification ability.
